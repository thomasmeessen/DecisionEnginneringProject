# Motivation

Lifestyle choices are difficult decisions that search trough a vast solution space for a optimum defined by a wide set of ethical criteria.
This decision making become increasingly difficult as recent developments in climate science have lead to new and strong concerns about atmospheric footprint and society resilience.
But even before that development it could have safely been stated that finding a global optimum for any set of economic or ethical constraints that a typical human being may have is out of the capability of 2020's science.
However when putting aside the search for global optimum help have successfully been provided to achieve a local maximization that only search the variations of a traditional consumption pattern.
The resulting ethical decision aids are for example used by consumer who find themselves in a supermarket and attribute preferences after consulting different labels that are present such as "Bio" or simply the price.
Indeed a label like the price-tag or the usage of petrochemical-based agriculture are tools that effectively help the consumers to cast their economical votes for their preferred final-products.

This does comes at a cost and the creation and maintenance of labeling framework is resource-intensive as it require an information aggregation process that gives a acceptable representation of reality and envelop the totality of the product life from the start of the production chain to the and of waste disposal.
One of the most primitive information chain is the cost in terms of human work and scarcity of resource that a product or service need to be available.
This aggregated information is obviously called money and it is so profoundly bounded with human society that it's cost is often not considered.
But for more recent labels such as Fair-trade or Biologic-agriculture the cost appear more clearly because those labels are services that might be sold by organization or created by regulation for the European energy efficiency indicator.

This indicate that aggregated information chain that support decision scheme are tools that should not only be studied based on their ranking pertinence but also on based their implementation cost.
The present work will acknowledge that strong interest may rise in the 2020's for a label related to the concept of Atmospheric Footprint(AF) due to the European political context and propose such pertinence-cost analysis for this kind of label.
To make the work feasible with the small quantity of resources allowed by this course (24h) the label will be restricted on a few products that are involved in saturated market in order for the label to have the most economic impact.
In addition the products should be characterized by a simple energetic-cost structure in order for the data generation to not require many hypotheses which could hamper any interpretation of the results.


For the purpose of this work the label definition will consist in the cheapest set of AF accounting rules that accurately represent the complete ranking for the studied market.
So different questions related to the impact on the customer will be left undiscussed to better concentrate the work on devision theory
Lastly to simply the construction the methodology of AF accounting this work assume a total electrification of the society because in order to allow relevant aggregation of energy costs such as time spent in the warehouse and the cost of truck transportation by km.
This assumption also allow to select an appropriate Joule to Atmospheric Footprint ratio based on the regional energy mix to establish the footprint based on an energy accounting.
And given the political orientation of European society more electrification is expected to happen to enable the use of renewable sources.

# Accounting principle

Resource accounting take it's root in ethical rules followed by many human civilization that limit resource spending to what can be harvested or taken from reserves.
Those rules have probably been developed early in in the human morale development and when dictate that a unconscious resource expenditure is antagonist to the concept of sustainability.
At the time of writing some empirical structures have represented the impact of the human activity on the atmosphere composition which have lead for a portion of the population to the extension of the concept of sustainability to include global environmental parameters.
However conceptual tools able to aggregate information concerning AF are not yet consensual so the reader is warned that the proposition included in this work while inspired from traditional accounting principles is novel and an had-hoc draft.

_Expenditure of energy are the exclusive responsibility of human being_

Expenditure of energy have to be traced to a conscious decision made by individuals either directly or indirectly trough a responsibility sharing construction.
When energy degraded and the amount of work obtained have to be attributed to a value chain voluntary supported by human.

__Examples:__

- The cost of commuting for employees of a bank is attributed by internal rules to the bank's clients.
- Energy spent by a state decision is attributed to it's members
- The warehouse maintenance cost is attributed to the involved products following specified repartition key.


Energy spent in investment is reported to human stakeholders.

__Examples:__

- Energy invested in the construction of a local store are paid by a local strategic group concerned with the supply of commodity that will report the cost to the members.
- The cost of a new delivery vehicle is assumed by the association of impacted consumers
- The owner of a company assume the energy spent that is not attributed to a client.

## Complexity of the problem

It is too difficult to have a precise estimate over the transformation cost and the packaging.
It is rendering the problem too simple as the number of dimension is too low.
