# Motivation

Universities are complex enterprises to manage because of the number and complexities of they products.
As a good example of university is the ULB and their missions are multiple:

- High quality teaching and life-quality while studying
- Making breakthrough in research
- Civil engagement in moral objectives like diversity and practical like language information
- Services to the industry
- International aid in development

To better manage the ever so scarce resources given the ambitions of the different missions, the university are often made of a number of faculty that pooled they resources.
One benefit of it is create an healthy environment where each project can compete for access to "large" pool of resources.
To resolve this competition is often a good practice to establish by negotiation coherent objectives at each management level (University, Faculty, Service, ...).
Based on this goal a strategy can be established and finally tactics can be compared, ranked and the best implementation plan proposed selected.


Such a tactical choice is the attribution of the resources for hiring a professor to each research group or service.
The importance of a professor to a service can not be underestimated, he will have the role of supporting teaching activities, will perform research and will come in addition to an existing team.
For good management practice the ULB ask to each faculty every 5 years what will they do with the resources that they have available.
While the contract of a professor is not limited to 5 years and everything is not reshuffled each time, the decision is still required for example due to smooth changes in the faculty's resources and possible departures that have happen during the last 5 years period.  


In that occasion the choice of the faculty at the ULB is called the Faculty development plan.
And one of the way it have been determined is a competition between profiles of professors suggested by existing research groups.
The choice of this tactical plan is complex and will mobilize a good deal of strategic reflexion within each group to build a profile that will benefit at best the university.
But the benefit space is large and possible categories of gain include research workforce, teaching activities attractiveness, industry synergy and also organization-based behavior like equity.


The faculty's management will face the elaboration of the tactical plan that will serve as a proposition on which voluntary elected stakeholders will debate.
This debate is the occasion of correcting mistakes in some evaluations of profiles or the relative importance of criteria.
To help with those debates using a multi-criteria decision aid is a must-have.
And producing an aggregation of the strategy, the situation, the possibilities using a pertinent methodology is the work anyone should do when preparing a debate.
It will guarantee both transparency, enabling efficient criticism and will dissociate what is best for the faculty (Strategic concern such as criteria weights) to the quality of a proposal something helping everyone to maintain a unbiased opinion.  

# Criteria

The criteria
The first category is composed by the evaluation grid that have been communicated by th a proposition of professorship is evaluated in a qualitative manner mostly in accordance with the strategic objectives of the school.
It is expected that the research group or teaching unit to describe the profile and present it's contribution to the strategic plan.
The document on which the argumentation is laid down is examined with respect to a grid proposed by the management team of the school.

## Criteria communicated prior to submission

_Associated teaching need_

An faculty program have submitted a profile for it's well being and development.
The critical aspect of the proposition is evaluated qualitatively based on the description submitted.

- 3: If not obtained some essentials parts of the programs will have to be dropped
- 2: Required to maintain current offer but minor adjustments are possible
- 1: Will contribute to the program's development.

For this criteria the difference between two alternatives are of exponential importance with regards to their score difference.


_Develop a research group in the direction defined by the school_

The sucess of an enterprise is often correlated with it's ability to concentrate it's resources on a select few chosen tasks or objectives.
The proposed profile is given a score for the synergy of it's research contribution with the school strategy.


- 3: Complete support of the strategy
- 2: The contribution consolidate actual current orientation
- 1: The subject is innovative or support ancient subjects

A innovative orientation is not much worse than a partial contribution but is better than it so a threshold of 1 is applied to evaluate the ranking contribution of this criteria.
Any correlation with the objective of joint programs is relevant in this criteria.

_Synergy with the school resource_

The candidate professorship is able to leverage the specificities of existing teams from both the teaching or the research point of view.

- 3: Strongly
- 2: Moderately
- 1: Marginally

No significant appreciation between the research or the teaching perspective is expressed. A gap of 2 in this score is more evaluated than a gap of one hence, a linear evaluation of the difference is chosen.

_Start-up cost_

Does the research activities require further funding to start ?

- 2: No
- 1: Yes

_Contractual research opportunity_

The research activity proposed is likely to attract industrial of institutional investment.
A simple 3 - shade score is proposed because of the likely relative lack of definition of the candidature.
An emphasis is put on research area that have already proven their attractiveness.

- 3: The field has been historically attractive
- 2: Given the economic development their is potential
- 1: Not of common industry interest

_Teaching attractiveness_

Having a rich program both in terms of quality or in terms of content is a fundamental to attract student and investment.
Having courses fleshed out with specialized knowledge from various professor is a strong point of differentiation.
A 3-shade description is simple enough to give a classification on a consensus might agree.

- 3: Contribute to multiple programs including prioritized programs
- 2: Contribute to enrichment of a specialized program
- 1: Inter courses synergies are not apparent

## Additional criteria

Those aspect of a professor profile have been submitted in addition to the required vision.
And/or have been used by management do describe their solution.

_Contractual obligation_

Previous contracts need this profile to be fulfilled, if their are satisfying other arrangement then "No" should be selected.

- 2: Yes
- 1: No

_Integration in a program strategy_

The program(s) benefiting from the potential professorship have made the proposal motivated by a strong strategic reflexion on the program cost-attractiveness.

- 3: The professorship is well integrated within the program strategy and reforms.
- 2: The program did not propose strategic evaluation on the program cost-attractiveness.

_Contribution to teaching cost_

Amount of reduction toward a specific degree cost,

- 3 = New program deliver a reduction of cost for a degree.
- 2 = Replacing existing courses, no change in the overall cost
- 1 = The majority of impacted program will see an increase of costs.


_Opinion of board of advisers_

A boards of selected industrial representatives have ranked each proposition following their insights on the future positioning that engineers should have.
Given the complexity of sampling the industry world to have a neutral opinion, the valuation of this rank will be a threshold of 2 ranks.


_Strategic partnership_

The profile is designed to reinforce, develop or fulfill strategic partnership with other faculty or organization.
This refer to historical or opportunistic relation that are not directly related to the poles but should be maintained.

- 2: The profile play an essential role.
- 1: No

_Investments exploitation_

External investment previously received by the faculty are available for exploitation by the proposed professorship.
It can be materials, team members that may result in additional results in terms of research.

- 2: Yes
- 1: No


# Alternatives

A possible development is a selection of 5 profile amongst the candidates.
Based on experiences, a faculty of polytechnic engineering can receive around 10 candidatures.
Here are the received:

- __[1] Mechanical and Aeronautical Engineering__ with emphasis on Multiphysics problem. This profile would strengthen strategic relation with the Von Kerman Institute, will develop the faculty towards space science and will assure the well-being of the Aerodynamic master.

- __[2] Data-Driven Modeling of Multi-Scale Biological Processes Modeling__. A profile aimed a developing a trans-disciplinary resource used in cooperation with a number of existing initiatives, it will further develop the faculty of Bioengineer and will some of the bachelor's mathematical course.
- __[3] Computational Quantum Mechanics__. Research profile in a historical domain of excellence at the ULB.
- __[4] Data-Science and Engineering__. Ensure the continuation of a contractual EU-funded master and strengthen the position of another inter-faculty master. The research potential is highly supported by the industry and exploit planned investment in research equipment.
- __[5] Structural Engineering__. Resource needed to fulfill a master. While research domain is pertinent no EU-funding in the research group and industry contract have been reported.
- __[6] Mathematic for the engineer__. Pedagogic profile of critical importance in all the faculty formation and contract-enabler for the industry by association to existing reasearch resources.  
- __[7] Nanophotonics__. Fulfilling existing course that have lost resources in a master and possible teaching opportunity in bachelor. Aimed in response to European's intent to assume leadership in Quantum Technologies and exploiting existing precious research equipment.
- __[8] Radiophysics__.
