# Motivation

Universities are complex enterprises to manage because of the number and complexities of they products.
As a good example of university is the ULB and their missions are multiple:

- High quality teaching and life-quality while studying
- Making breakthrough in research
- Civil engagement in moral objectives like diversity and practical like language information
- Services to the industry
- International aid in development

To better manage the ever so scarce resources given the ambitons of the different missions, the university are often made of a number of faculty that pooled they resources.
One benefit of it is create an healthy environment where each project can compete for access to "large" pool of resources.
To resolve this competition is often a good practice to establish by negotiation coherent objectives at each management level (University, Faculty, Service, ...).
Based on this goal a strategy can be established and finally tactics can be compared, ranked and the best implementation plan proposed selected.


Such a tactical choice is the attribution of the resources for hiring a professor to each research group or service.
The importance of a professor to a service can not be underestimated, he will have the role of supporting teaching activities, will perform research and will come in addition to an existing team.
For good management practice the ULB ask to each faculty every 5 years what will they do with the resources that they have available.
While the contract of a professor is not limited to 5 years and everything is not reshuffled each time, the decision is still required for example due to smooth changes in the faculty's resources and possible departures that have happen during the last 5 years period.  


In that occasion the choice of the faculty at the ULB is called the Faculty development plan.
And one of the way it have been determined is a competition between profiles of professors suggested by existing research groups.
The choice of this tactical plan is complex and will mobilize a good deal of strategic reflexion within each group to build a profile that will benefit at best the university.
But the benefit space is large and possible categories of gain include research workforce, teaching activities attractiveness, industry synergy and also organization-based behavior like equity.


The faculty's management will face the elaboration of the tactical plan that will serve as a proposition on which voluntary elected stakeholders will debate.
This debate is the occasion of correcting mistakes in some evaluations of profiles or the relative importance of criteria.
To help with those debates using a multi-criteria decision aid is a must-have.
And producing an aggregation of the strategy, the situation, the possibilities using a pertinent methodology is the work anyone should do when preparing a debate.
It will guarantee both transparency, enabling efficient criticism and will dissociate what is best for the faculty (Strategic concern such as criteria weights) to the quality of a proposal something helping everyone to maintain a unbiased opinion.
