# Motivation

Universities are the seat of a number of complex decision where balance are needed between different objectives;

- High quality teaching and life-quality while studying
- Making breakthrough in research
- Civil engagement in moral objectives like diversity and practical like language information
- Services to the industry
- International aid in development

To better manage the ever so scarce resources and given the ambitions of the different missions the universities are often made of a number of faculty that pooled they resources.
It ideally create an healthy environment in which each project can compete for access to a "large" pool of resources.
Resolving this competition often require good practices in negotiating coherent objectives at each level of management (University, Faculty, Service, ...).


A common tactical choice assumed by each faculty is the attribution of the resources into selected professorship.
The importance of a professor to a service can not be underestimated and for good management practice sometimes the faculty ask proposals to complete a 5 years development plan.
With the contract of a professor not limited to 5 years, everything is not reshuffled at each time.
But decisions are still required for example to smooth changes in the faculty's resources pool and to reallocate eventual or planned departures.  


The choice of this tactical plan is complex and will mobilize strategic reflexion within each group to build a candidate profile that might give the best benefit to the faculty.
But the benefit space is large and possible categories of gain include research workforce, teaching activities attractiveness, industry synergy and also organization-based behavior like equity.


This case seemed relevant to assess the possibility of a Decision-Making tool called D-Sight.
On paper it would propose a grounded, complex and interesting choice offering a good experience of using this tool in a management case.

# Criteria

The differentiation of each proposal is based on a the submitted strategic assessment made by each smaller entity inside the school.
The articulation between different points of comparison is started by the required list of evaluation published by the management prior to the submission.
Then because it is the first time the process happen a series of others aspects emerge from the submitted work.
And later came some last characteristics identified while debating the ranking.

## Criteria communicated prior to submission

_Associated teaching need_

An faculty program have submitted a profile for it's well being and development.
The critical aspect of the proposition is evaluated qualitatively based on the description submitted.

- 3: If not obtained some essentials parts of the programs will have to be dropped
- 2: Required to maintain current offer but minor adjustments are possible
- 1: Will contribute to the program's development.

For this criteria the difference between two alternatives are of exponential importance with regards to their score difference.


_Develop a research group in the direction defined by the school_

The sucess of an enterprise is often correlated with it's ability to concentrate it's resources on a select few chosen tasks or objectives.
The proposed profile is given a score for the synergy of it's research contribution with the school strategy.


- 3: Complete support of the strategy
- 2: The contribution consolidate actual current orientation
- 1: The subject is innovative or support ancient subjects

A innovative orientation is not much worse than a partial contribution but is better than it so a threshold of 1 is applied to evaluate the ranking contribution of this criteria.
Any correlation with the objective of joint programs is relevant in this criteria.

_Synergy with the school resource_

The candidate professorship is able to leverage the specificities of existing teams from both the teaching or the research point of view.

- 3: Strongly
- 2: Moderately
- 1: Marginally

No significant appreciation between the research or the teaching perspective is expressed. A gap of 2 in this score is more evaluated than a gap of one hence, a linear evaluation of the difference is chosen.

_Start-up cost_

Does the research activities require further funding to start ?

- 2: No
- 1: Yes

_Contractual research opportunity_

The research activity proposed is likely to attract industrial of institutional investment.
A simple 3 - shade score is proposed because of the likely relative lack of definition of the candidature.
An emphasis is put on research area that have already proven their attractiveness.

- 3: The field has been historically attractive
- 2: Given the economic development their is potential
- 1: Not of common industry interest

_Teaching attractiveness_

Having a rich program both in terms of quality or in terms of content is a fundamental to attract student and investment.
Having courses fleshed out with specialized knowledge from various professor is a strong point of differentiation.
A 3-shade description is simple enough to give a classification on a consensus might agree.

- 3: Contribute to multiple programs including prioritized programs
- 2: Contribute to enrichment of a specialized program
- 1: Inter courses synergies are not apparent

## Additional criteria

Those aspect of a professor profile have been submitted in addition to the required vision.
And/or have been used by management do describe their solution.

_Contractual obligation_

In the case of previous contracts needing this profile to be fulfilled this criteria is set to be advantageous.

One way to use this criteria is to set the associated weight to 0.
If the required profiles are not at the top then one can increase the importance of it until the result is satisfying.
The importance of this criteria can be computed for each concerned alternative in order to represent how competitive the alternatives are.
Moreover, it provides an estimate on the loss of opportunity caused by a contract.

Values:

- 2: Yes
- 1: No

_Integration in a program strategy_

The program(s) benefiting from the potential professorship have made the proposal motivated by a strong strategic reflexion on the program cost-attractiveness.

- 2: The professorship is well integrated within the program strategy and reforms.
- 1: The program did not propose strategic evaluation on the program cost-attractiveness.

_Contribution to teaching cost_

The context of the decision is one of scarcity and as such one objective is to reduce the cost by student of each program.
If impacted courses are intended to develop a program they receive a minus while professorship resulting from a merging of previous functions will obtain a bonus.

- 3 = New program deliver a reduction of cost for a degree.
- 2 = Replacing existing courses, no change in the overall cost
- 1 = The majority of impacted program will see an increase of costs.


_Opinion of board of advisers_

A boards of selected industrial representatives have ranked each proposition following their insights on the future positioning that engineers should have.
Given the complexity of sampling the industry to create a board able to give a neutral opinion only three category will used.

- 3: Top performer
- 2: Average interest
- 1: Weak potential.


_Strategic partnership_

The profile is designed to reinforce, develop or fulfill strategic partnership with other faculty or organization.
This refer to historical or opportunistic relation that are not directly related to the poles but should be maintained.

- 2: The profile play an essential role.
- 1: No

_Investments exploitation_

External investment previously received by the faculty are available for exploitation by the proposed professorship.
It can be materials, team members that may result in additional results in terms of research.

- 2: Yes
- 1: No


# Alternatives

Due to the favorable context the alternative set is inspired from a recent submission process.
The following profile for a future professorship have been presented.

- __[1] Mechanical and Aeronautical Engineering__ with emphasis on Multiphysics problem. This profile would strengthen strategic relation with the Von Kerman Institute, will develop the faculty towards space science and will assure the well-being of the Aerodynamic master.

- __[2] Data-Driven Modeling of Multi-Scale Biological Processes Modeling__. A profile aimed a developing a trans-disciplinary resource used in cooperation with a number of existing initiatives, it will further develop the faculty of Bioengineer and will some of the bachelor's mathematical course.
- __[3] Computational Quantum Mechanics__. Research profile in a historical domain of excellence at the ULB.
- __[4] Data-Science__. Ensure the continuation of a contractual EU-funded master and strengthen the position of another inter-faculty master. The research potential is highly supported by the industry and exploit planned investment in research equipment.
- __[5] Structural Engineering__. Resource needed to fulfill a master. While research domain is pertinent no EU-funding in the research group and industry contract have been reported.
- __[6] Mathematic for the engineer__. Pedagogic profile of critical importance in all the faculty formation and contract-enabler for the industry by association to existing reasearch resources.  
- __[7] Nanophotonics__. Fulfilling existing course that have lost resources in a master and possible teaching opportunity in bachelor. Aimed in response to European's intent to assume leadership in Quantum Technologies and exploiting existing precious research equipment.
- __[8] Radiophysics__.
- __[9]Cybersecurity of communicating systems__. A important field of expertise nowadays, the development of cybersecurity is strongly supported by the faculty and associated partners.
The professorship will contribute to number of existing program, some of which are required by contracts.

The alternative set here presented do not cover the entire range of possible alternative.
The reasons is that there is a strong context of cost reduction that have restricted the authors to proposal that are tightly narrow to pass the evaluation grid.
Most of them are also born from a more or less reformed version of a professorship that have recently been closed.

One result is that no proposition have required a start-up cost.
Soo that criteria is dropped

## Discrimination power

__Teaching needs__ have a little discriminating power because the context of recession have created a implicit restriction on the proposed profile to only what is required to maintain much of the previous offer in terms of courses.
This criterion is marked for potential reduction.

The __Setup cost__ has already been mentioned to have no power due to the recession context and is removed from the discussion.

__Contractual opportunity__ is also not relevant given the sampling of proposals that is available.

# Weights

A number of the studied points of differences concern naturally the alignment of the proposal with the faculty strategy in terms of research and reduction of cost.
Creating the concept of strategic alignment score seems a good start to create the relative evaluation of each points.

So to build such indicators a first question could be:

_Given two solutions is it preferred to have a slightly better research alignment or a advantages in terms of cost by student?_

Immediately anyone will tells that this question is not pertinent because it do not reflect the complexity of the reality.
The two advantages are not comparable because there is not enough resolution in the informations available to cast a meaningful vote.
So having an advantages in one of those category is highly recommendable but management is not yet at a level on which cost analysis of a program are precise and trusted or the best research direction is known.

Because the two indicators have no relative evaluation a possible alternative a to build an aggregate of them using the following rule extended for disadvantages:

| Research alignment       | +  | + | 0 | + |
| Cost reduction           | +  | 0 | + | 0 |
|--------------------------|----|---|---|---|
| Strategic Alignment (SA) | ++ | + | + | + |

The aggregated strategy alignment can be compared for example to the __value of strategic partnership__.
The following statement is probably consensual "Strategic partnership should happen at the cost of some strategic alignment".
That proposition is reflecting that some highly efficient investment granted by partnership are worth spreading the faculty resources.
The comparison can now be fleshed out by specifying that a good partnership should allow a outranking of 1 step so the relative weight is __1/8 of the SA's weight__.


To further study the SA let's consider the role of __synergies for research__.
It seems that giving up a strategic advantage for any sort of synergy inside different research teams is not an option this criteria will be evaluated relatively to the SA as a __tie breaker__.
For that role, a weight __between 1/10 and 1/18 of SA__ should be assigned.

Next, the __enrichment of the courses also play a role of tie-breaker for the teaching need__
with the same range of relative weight proposed.
However given the non discriminating aspect of the teaching need it is not suitable to reason like that.

What about the case of programs that submit a __professorship without an accompanying reform__ of the program?
It seems that this criterion is logically tied to the reduction of cost and the strategical position of the program.
But it is more a no go criterion that trigger the rework of the proposal than a pertinent discriminating aspect.
However in the case studied the prior statements did not included it as a requirement.
Impacted alternatives are then __dropped without practical option of resubmitting__ a proposal.



# Discussion

The determination of relative weight between criteria is a complex endeavor.
In this case however, it was disappointingly easy because there a a lot of criteria which have a role of tie-breaker.
