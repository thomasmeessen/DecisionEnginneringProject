# Reduction of accounting post energy footprint classification applied to a set of food recipe.

## Motivation

Lifestyle choices are difficult decisions that search trough a vast solution space for a optimum defined by a wide set of ethical criteria.
This decision become increasingly difficult for example due to recent development in climate science that have risen new and strong concerns on atmospheric footprint and society resilience with regard to climate change.
Even before that it could safely be stated that finding a global optimum for any set of economic or ethical constraints that a typical human being have is out of the capability of 2020's science.
However, putting aside the search for global optimum, help can and have been provided in achieving a maximization within that look locally within a traditional consumption pattern.
Those local ethical decision aid schemes are used by consumer who, once in a supermarket, attribute preferences after consulting the presence of the label "Bio" or the price.
Indeed labeling framework like price-tag and usage of petrochemical-based agriculture are tools that effectively help the consumers to cast their economical votes for their preferred final-products.

The creation and maintenance of labeling framework is a resource-intensive task as it require an information aggregation process that envelop the totality of the product production life and that give a acceptable representation of reality.
The primal information chain is the cost in terms of human work and scarcity of resource that a product require.
This aggregated information called money and is so profoundly bounded with human society that it's cost is often not considered.
But for more recent labels such as Fair-trade or Biologic-agriculture the cost are clear because those labels are services sold by organization or some like the European energy efficiency label are created by regulation.

Aggregated information chain that support decision scheme are tools that should be studied not only based on their pertinence but also on their implementation cost.
This work looks into the interests for a label related to the concept of atmospheric footprint(AF).
Such interests may indeed rise in the 2020's European political context would be joined by  the question of the implementation cost .
To comment on the form that this proposed label could take to be economically relevant in the food industry this work will attempt to define the cheapest set of rule for AF accounting that accurately represent AF for Intra-Taste products variations (variations of ingredients that give the same culinary experience).
This choice to not bother studying AF ordering for recipe is due to the relatively small price of this work and the increased decision power that the label have on the ingredients if the consumer's vote is bounded by a recipe ranking at the top of his taste ordering.
Only variations of the products bought for the same recipe will be considered.
But it should be mentioned that this behavior is highly dependent of the consumer segment and with client less loyal to a specific taste would probably be more interested in looking to the highest ranking recipe and would consult the label score for a wider range.

The label's corner stone, the methodology used to establish AF accounting rules, assume a total electrification of the society because it allow for relevant aggregation of costs that would be otherwise difficult such as time spent in the warehouse and truck-km.
Another advantage of this hypotheses is that the reader may select the appropriate Watt to Atmospheric Footprint ratio based on his regional energy mix to further quantify the label.
It should also be mentioned that due to political orientation European society is likely to progress toward total electrification giving further relevance to this hypothesis.

## Accounting principles

The fundamental principle of energy accounting is that no human want to spend more energy that it can harvest from the sun or collect from it's reserve for ethical reasons.
It is an labeling or decision aid that differentiate from the money system in that it is decoupling benefit from energy spending because building a comfortable home does not allow to produce more energy.
For this work it is supposed that that property give this tool the ability for asociety to achieve ethicals objectives.
One of the first practical rules is that energy expenditure have to be associated with human consumption which means that no organization can sunk energy cost and all expenditure must be reported towards it's intended service.

__Examples:__

- The cost of commuting for employees of a bank have to be reported to it's client charge.
- State's functioning cost are reported to it's members
- The warehouse maintenance cost is reported to it's products


Energy cost paid in investment is to be reported to human stakeholders.
If such investment develop a new service or modify an existing one the cost have to be assumed before energy consumption.

__Examples:__

- Energy invested in the construction of a local store are paid by a local supply strategic group that will report the cost to his members.
- The cost of a new delivery vehicle is assumed by the association of impacted consumers
- Quality of Life investment and maintenance group regularly report back cost to it's members with regard to the member preferences and the group's defining philosophy.

Energy budget can be reported to humans after consumption is the case of satisfying market and process security.
Market and process security policy are defined based on at least the volume of embedded energy that is likely to fail to be sold and the volume of likely waste.

__Examples:__

- There is a constant need for local supply of leeks which allow the company to report the cost of the service at the moment of delivery and include in it the variable cost of wasted products.
- If a northern village want to have access to a exotic the service price have to be paid before the delivery.

## Ingredient Home-cost

The Intra-Taste recipe variation is looking to change in the ingredient ranking originated from production chain with the inclusion of seasonal change.
This approach does not focus on recipe ranking and do not look to produce ethically significant labeling rank (the difference between products rank might be insignificant for the  atmospheric footprint) but rather a giving a low-cost but strongly relevant competitive edge to the label's client.

Scenario:

- Supermarket
- Local Supermarket
- Home delivery


The food industry is highly vertically integrated which mean that

#### Growth

#### Harvest

#### Distribution chain

#### Client

What is the minimum set of criteria to apply to each ingredient and the recipe itself so that the full ranking is preserved but is more easily applicable.
