Motivation
==========

Universities are the seat of a number of complex decision where balance
are needed between different objectives;

-   High quality teaching and life-quality while studying
-   Making breakthrough in research
-   Civil engagement in moral objectives like diversity and practical
    like language information
-   Services to the industry
-   International aid in development

To better manage the ever so scarce resources and given the ambitions of
the different missions the universities are often made of a number of
faculty that pooled they resources. It ideally create an healthy
environment in which each project can compete for access to a "large"
pool of resources. Resolving this competition often require good
practices in negotiating coherent objectives at each level of management
(University, Faculty, Service, ...).

A common tactical choice assumed by each faculty is the attribution of
the resources into selected professorship. The importance of a professor
to a service can not be underestimated and for good management practice
sometimes the faculty ask proposals to complete a 5 years development
plan. With the contract of a professor not limited to 5 years,
everything is not reshuffled at each time. But decisions are still
required for example to smooth changes in the faculty's resources pool
and to reallocate eventual or planned departures.

The choice of this tactical plan is complex and will mobilize strategic
reflexion within each group to build a candidate profile that might give
the best benefit to the faculty. But the benefit space is large and
possible categories of gain include research workforce, teaching
activities attractiveness, industry synergy and also organization-based
behavior like equity.

This case seemed relevant to assess the possibility of a Decision-Making
tool called D-Sight. On paper it would propose a grounded, complex and
interesting choice offering a good experience of using this tool in a
management case.

Criteria
========

The differentiation of each proposal is based on a the submitted
strategic assessment made by each smaller entity inside the school. The
articulation between different points of comparison is started by the
required list of evaluation published by the management prior to the
submission. These however are not all off the criteria that have been
applied as it was the first time that process was implemented. Some
others characteristics have been found to emerge from the following
debates or from the submitted files.

Criteria communicated prior to submission
-----------------------------------------

*Associated teaching need*

An faculty program have submitted a profile for it's well being and
development. The critical aspect of the proposition is evaluated
qualitatively based on the description submitted.

-   3: If not obtained some essentials parts of the programs will have
    to be dropped
-   2: Required to maintain current offer but minor adjustments are
    possible
-   1: Will contribute to the program's development.

For this criteria the difference between two alternatives are of
exponential importance with regards to their score difference.

*Develop a research group in the direction defined by the school*

The sucess of an enterprise is often correlated with it's ability to
concentrate it's resources on a select few chosen tasks or objectives.
The proposed profile is given a score for the synergy of it's research
contribution with the school strategy.

-   3: Complete support of the strategy
-   2: The contribution consolidate actual current orientation
-   1: The subject is innovative or support ancient subjects

A innovative orientation is not much worse than a partial contribution
but is better than it so a threshold of 1 is applied to evaluate the
ranking contribution of this criteria. Any correlation with the
objective of joint programs is relevant in this criteria.

*Synergy with the school resource*

The candidate professorship is able to leverage the specificities of
existing teams from both the teaching or the research point of view.

-   3: Strongly
-   2: Moderately
-   1: Marginally

No significant appreciation between the research or the teaching
perspective is expressed. A gap of 2 in this score is more evaluated
than a gap of one hence, a linear evaluation of the difference is
chosen.

*Start-up cost*

Does the research activities require further funding to start ?

-   2: No
-   1: Yes

*Contractual research opportunity*

The research activity proposed is likely to attract industrial of
institutional investment. A simple 3 - shade score is proposed because
of the likely relative lack of definition of the candidature. An
emphasis is put on research area that have already proven their
attractiveness.

-   3: The field has been historically attractive
-   2: Given the economic development their is potential
-   1: Not of common industry interest

*Teaching attractiveness*

Having a rich program both in terms of quality or in terms of content is
a fundamental to attract student and investment. Having courses fleshed
out with specialized knowledge from various professor is a strong point
of differentiation. A 3-shade description is simple enough to give a
classification on a consensus might agree.

-   3: Contribute to multiple programs including prioritized programs
-   2: Contribute to enrichment of a specialized program
-   1: Inter courses synergies are not apparent

Discovered criteria
-------------------

Those aspect of a professor profile have been submitted in addition to
the required vision. And/or have been used by management do describe
their solution.

*Contractual obligation*

In the case of previous contracts needing this profile to be fulfilled
this criteria is set to be advantageous.

One way to use this criteria is to set the associated weight to 0. If
the required profiles are not at the top then one can increase the
importance of it until the result is satisfying. The importance of this
criteria can be computed for each concerned alternative in order to
represent how competitive the alternatives are. Moreover, it provides an
estimate on the loss of opportunity caused by a contract.

Values:

-   2: Yes
-   1: No

*Integration in a program strategy*

The program(s) benefiting from the potential professorship have made the
proposal motivated by a strong strategic reflexion on the program
cost-attractiveness.

-   2: The professorship is well integrated within the program strategy
    and reforms.
-   1: The program did not propose strategic evaluation on the program
    cost-attractiveness.

*Contribution to teaching cost*

The context of the decision is one of scarcity and as such one objective
is to reduce the cost by student of each program. If impacted courses
are intended to develop a program they receive a minus while
professorship resulting from a merging of previous functions will obtain
a bonus.

-   3 = New program deliver a reduction of cost for a degree.
-   2 = Replacing existing courses, no change in the overall cost
-   1 = The majority of impacted program will see an increase of costs.

*Opinion of board of advisers*

A boards of selected industrial representatives have ranked each
proposition following their insights on the future positioning that
engineers should have. Given the complexity of sampling the industry to
create a board able to give a neutral opinion only three category will
used.

-   3: Top performer
-   2: Average interest
-   1: Weak potential.

*Strategic partnership*

The profile is designed to reinforce, develop or fulfill strategic
partnership with other faculty or organization. This refer to historical
or opportunistic relation that are not directly related to the poles but
should be maintained.

-   2: The profile play an essential role.
-   1: No

*Investments exploitation*

External investment previously received by the faculty are available for
exploitation by the proposed professorship. It can be materials, team
members that may result in additional results in terms of research.

-   2: Yes
-   1: No

Alternatives
============

Due to the favorable context the alternative set is inspired from a
recent submission process. The following profile for a future
professorship have been presented.

-   **\[1\] Mechanical and Aeronautical Engineering** with emphasis on
    Multiphysics problem. This profile would strengthen strategic
    relation with the Von Kerman Institute, will develop the faculty
    towards space science and will assure the well-being of the
    Aerodynamic master.

-   **\[2\] Data-Driven Modeling of Multi-Scale Biological Processes
    Modeling**. A profile aimed a developing a trans-disciplinary
    resource used in cooperation with a number of existing initiatives,
    it will further develop the faculty of Bioengineer and will some of
    the bachelor's mathematical course.

-   **\[3\] Computational Quantum Mechanics**. Research profile in a
    historical domain of excellence at the ULB.

-   **\[4\] Data-Science**. Ensure the continuation of a contractual
    EU-funded master and strengthen the position of another
    inter-faculty master. The research potential is highly supported by
    the industry and exploit planned investment in research equipment.

-   **\[5\] Structural Engineering**. Resource needed to fulfill a
    master. While research domain is pertinent no EU-funding in the
    research group and industry contract have been reported.

-   **\[6\] Mathematic for the engineer**. Pedagogic profile of critical
    importance in all the faculty formation and contract-enabler for the
    industry by association to existing reasearch resources.\

-   **\[7\] Nanophotonics**. Fulfilling existing course that have lost
    resources in a master and possible teaching opportunity in bachelor.
    Aimed in response to European's intent to assume leadership in
    Quantum Technologies and exploiting existing precious research
    equipment.

-   **\[8\] Radiophysics**.

-   **\[9\]Cybersecurity of communicating systems**. A important field
    of expertise nowadays, the development of cybersecurity is strongly
    supported by the faculty and associated partners. The professorship
    will contribute to number of existing program, some of which are
    required by contracts.

Discrimination power
--------------------

**Teaching needs** have a little discriminating power because the
context of recession have created a implicit restriction on the proposed
profile to only what is required to maintain much of the previous offer
in terms of courses. This criterion is marked for potential reduction.

The **Setup cost** has already been mentioned to have no power due to
the recession context and is removed from the discussion.

**Contractual opportunity** is also not relevant given the sampling of
proposals that is available.

Weights
=======

A number of the studied points of differences concern naturally the
alignment of the proposal with the faculty strategy in terms of research
and reduction of cost. Creating the concept of strategic alignment score
seems a good start to create the relative evaluation of each points.

Strategic alignment
-------------------

*Given two solutions is it preferred to have a slightly better research
alignment or a advantages in terms of cost by student?*

Immediately anyone will tells that this question is not pertinent
because it do not reflect the complexity of the reality. The two types
of advantages are not comparable. Mainly because there is not enough
resolution in the informations available to cast a meaningful vote. More
precisely, the management is not yet at a level that enable a program
cost analysis precise and trusted or to formulate the best research
direction. Because the two indicators have no relative evaluation a
possible alternative a to build an aggregate of them using the following
rule extended for disadvantages:

  --------------------- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----
   Research alignment    \+   \+   0    \+   \-   \-
     Cost reduction      \+   0    \+   0    \+   \-
   Strategic Alignment   ++   \+   \+   \+   \-   --
  --------------------- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----

This table is not practical therefore a approximation should be used
such as giving to each separate alignment an equal weight.

**Strategic alignement (SA) = 1/2 ( Research + Cost )**

Breaking a tie
--------------

Strategic Alignment is understandably the most important criteria
however it has a limited resolution. The role of a tie breaker is push
the profile that present the best design but not giving it enough so
that it may step over one advantage in alignment.

**weight(Marginal advantage) = 1/6 weight(Strategic alignment)**

The criteria that have the potential to give a marginal advantage are
the following:

-   Research synergies
-   Contractual opportunities
-   Board of advisers
-   Investments exploitation
-   Startup cost
-   Teaching attractiveness

To assign the relative weight it is required to introduce some new
assumption on what could be a desired solution. Note that those
assumptions should be debated by a strategic committee before usage.

*A good research synergy and enrichment of the program should place the
alternative at the top*

*Potential contracts and the opinion of advisers are more important than
not having to acquire new equipment*

*Exploiting existing investment is not as much important as following
the trend in the industry*

With the result :

  --------------------------- ------
  Research synergies          30
  Teaching attractiveness     30
  Board of advisers           12.5
  Startup cost                10
  Investments exploitation    5
  Contractual opportunities   12.5
  Marginal advantage          100
  --------------------------- ------

The importance of a strategic partnership
-----------------------------------------

*Strategic partnership should be allowed to happen at the cost of some
strategic alignment.*

That proposition is reflecting that some highly efficient investment
granted by partnership are worth spreading the faculty resources. The
comparison can now be fleshed out by specifying that a good partnership
should allow a outranking of 1 step.

**weight(Strategic Partnership) = 1/5 weight(Strategic Alignment)**

No-go criterion
---------------

What about the case of programs that submit a **professorship without an
accompanying reform** of the program? It seems that this criterion is
logically tied to the reduction of cost and the strategical position of
the program. But it is more a no go criterion that should trigger the
rework of the proposal than a pertinent discriminating aspect. However
in the case studied the prior statements did not included it as a
requirement leaving the impacted alternatives to be **dropped without
practical option of resubmitting** a proposal.

Discussion
==========

The determination of relative weight between criteria is a complex
endeavor. In this case however, it was disappointingly easy because
there a a lot of criteria which have a role of tie-breaker.
