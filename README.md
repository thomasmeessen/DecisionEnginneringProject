# Reduction of accounting post energy footprint classification applied to a set of food recipe.

## Motivation

Lifestyle choice are very often taken in consideration with a set of ethical criteria and recent development in climate science have risen new and strong concerns.
As for any economic or ethical constraint the search of a global optimum for a wide set of objective coupled in a vast solution space can be safely assumed to be out of the scope of 2020's science.
However help have been provided to achieve local maximization within a traditional consumption pattern.
Those local ethical decision scheme are demonstrated by consumer who gives preference to "Bio" or "low-cost" products once in a supermarket.
Indeed labeling framework like price-tag and usage of petrochemical-based agriculture tools are effectively decision aids that help consumers to cast their economical votes to their preferred final-products.

The creation and maintenance of labeling framework is a resource-intensive task as it require an information aggregation chain that give a acceptable representation of reality.
The primal information chain is the accounting for the amount of human work and scarcity of resource required for a product and it is so profoundly bounded with human society that it's cost is often not considered.
More recent labels such as Fair-trade or Biologic-agriculture have clear cost definition as their are services sold by organization like Fair-Trade Belgium and some like the European energy efficiency label are created by regulation.

Aggregated information chain that support decision scheme are tools that should be studied based on their pertinence and implementation cost.
Because interests for such tool applied to the field of atmospheric footprint may rise in the 2020's European political context this work concern a cost-pertinence study for a food recipe atmospheric footprint label.
To make this label economically relevant this work will approximate the cheapest set of account that can preserve Intra-Taste (variations with the same culinary experience) and Extra-Taste (variations that compete against culinary taste ordering).
Due to the relatively small price of this work the IT variation will be the focus as the decision power of the studied label will greatly reduced if it's vote is casted against the taste ordering (Consumer native taste ordering).

The label's corner stone, the methodology used for accounting energy consumption, assume a total electrification of the society allowing for relevant aggregation and comparison of energy consumption that would be otherwise difficult such as time spent in the oven and truck-km.
Another advantage of this hypotheses is that the reader may select the appropriate Watt to atmospheric footprint ration based on his regional energy mix to further quantify the label.
It should also be mentioned that due to political orientation European society is likely to progress toward total electrification given further motivation to this hypothesis.
